## Prerequisites
0. **_BACK UP YOUR WORK_**
  * Version control is not a replacement for backups!
  * If you haven't done this recently, do it now before messing around with your file system!
1. \*nix terminal
  * Linux / Mac: You already have one of these ü§ô
  * Windows 10: Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). See how to get set up [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10); I suggest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
  * Windows 8 / 8.1: See the git section below.
  * Windows 7: Please note that this version of Windows has reached its End-of-Life and will no longer receive security updates. It appears that it is still possible to upgrade to Windows 10 for free, so consider doing that. Otherwise, you should be able to follow the same instructions as Windows 8.
  * Final note: You should probably have at least a passing familiarity with how to get around at a command line. This tutorial will provide most of the commands you'll need, but it's good to have some working practice getting around. One resource with everything you'll ever need to know is [The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line), but if you have a better idea, we'll see how you might suggest in a little bit...
2. git
  * Linux / Mac / WSL: You probably already have git, so check in your terminal with `git --version`. If not, check out the [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  * Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1: Since we will cover git's command line interface (CLI), your best bet is [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). Alternatively, there are GUI tools (like GitHub Desktop) that are useful and perhaps *more* intuitive, but do not necessarily expose all of the tools and cross-platform consistency the CLI provides.
3. Set up name and email
  * `git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"`
  * `git config --global user.email "email@example.com"` *(Note: if signing up for GitHub, use the same email here. It's OK to use a different one, but you'll have to change a setting to ensure your commits are associated with your account.)*
  * The above commands set your ID for all repos, but can also be set on a per-repo basis by omitting `--global`.
4. GitHub account\*
  * Sign up at https://github.com/ with the email you set in git.
  * Be sure to enable two factor authentication (2FA) with an app. Best practice is *NOT* to give a SMS number as they are vulnerable to [sim swap attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam).
  * Print out your recovery codes and keep them somewhere safe.
  * Authentication can be handled in a number of ways, as detailed [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage). Long story short, if you are on Windows, use [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows), and if you are on Mac, use keychain with `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain`. If you're on another flavor, you have some tradeoffs to consider.
5. Think about where to perform the tutorial
  * Some people create a directory like `~/Projects`. This can be any useful, consistent place to import and run code.
  * Of course, the concepts covered here can be applied anywhere in the file system, but if you're just starting out, it's probably best not to experiment with your academic work.

\*Optional. While the topic is outside of the scope of today's discussion, some may object to the use of GitHub as a code host. GitHub is owned by Microsoft and presents certain concerns with respect to open-source, free, non-proprietary, and decentralized software ideals, not to mention a desire to avoid a de facto monoculture. GitHub is incorporated and hosted in the US. Using git without a centralized repository, or at least with an open-source alternative (see [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)) is absolutely possible, but given the immediate lack of a supported tool at IJLR‚àÇA, we will use it as an example of how to interface with these types of systems. That said, its popularity means that collaboration frequently happens there in industry and academia, and may therefore be of use for you to learn.

## What is version control?
Version control is a term used to represent the idea that changes to content (code, articles, configuration) can be tracked over time. This can be as simple as adding a version number to note how many revisions a document has gone through (which may not actually preserve the previous revisions, though in the case of a book, those previous revisions are out in the world). At present, where much of our content is digital ephemera, it's as important as ever to keep track of changes to content - not necessarily just for a single file, but for complex collections of interdependent modules - as well as the real-world demands on and outcomes resulting from such a project. In short, we're describing modern software development.

We think of ourselves as scientists, but in reality, most of us are also developers. If you code, have dependencies that change (but that you need to control to guarantee consistency), write in text files that you update, or anxiously make copies of folders in the fear of losing or breaking something, version control can help you to track and (if need be) recover your work.

## What is git?
Git is a version control system (VCS) that implements many of the concepts above. A git repository is simply a directory that is being tracked with git. A repository can be on your local machine or on a remote server. Git is a distributed VCS, meaning that each user tracks the whole history of a given repository - though they might all be on different computers, each copy has a local working version and knows everything that occurred to arrive at it (though they may be in varying states of synchrony).

In git, there is no need to "check out" or "freeze" a file for everyone else when someone is working on it, as may be the case in a centralized VCS. As such, multiple authors can track their work locally simultaneously, eventually communicating their changes to others whose repositories are then updated to match. This style of work also informs the culture and norms of working with git, particularly with respect to "rewriting history" - while this is allowable locally (and sometimes even encouraged, in the case of "squashing" commits before a merge), it's a pretty grave faux pas when working with a shared repository.

### Contrast with GitHub
GitHub *is not* git. GitHub is a host that is usually interfaced with through git, but which provides some other services and access control on top of the "version control" part of git. For example, reporting a bug on GitHub is not a part of git, whereas the web interface allows users to perform some git-like actions in a repository (such as making an edit to a file and committing it). Most interaction with GitHub happens through git, usually by copying a repository locally or by pushing your changes back up to the hosted version.

This centralization comes with benefits, as a consistently available shared host can be a convenient place to sync things across many machines (one possible use case of git) or as a definitive source of releases (basically named revisions) for users that are not going to interact with the source content. Other things that GitHub offers (as is the case with other service providers) are integration with CI/CD pipelines (automatic actions that happen when you update code), forums, and other things that are useful for the work surrounding development but are not related to actually changing content. However, it cannot be stressed enough that those other things are not git.

### Comparison with other VCS
Perhaps the first thing to point out in comparing git to other VCS is its "popularity," at least in the open-source realm. (It's also frequently complained about, but it appears to get the job done...) A StackOverflow developer survey in 2018 found that [87% of their respondents](https://web.archive.org/web/20190530142357/https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#work-_-version-control) used git for version control. With that popularity comes benefits, as in the massive amount of information, integrations, and know-how in the world. Just looking at the major hosts, it's clear to see that git is the VCS of choice. While it may not be so clearly cut in the professional world, where some industries lean toward their own set of tools in common, I think it's fair to say that git isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and you will probably come across it if there is ever a case where you need to do some collaborative software development.

That said, other VCS can be successful by doing things differently or more specifically. For example, while pipelines exist for CI/CD that hook into git, this is essentially a fancy way of scheduling a process to run on someone else's computer (the cloud‚Ñ¢ ‚òÅ). Some programming languages that have bindings with a custom VCS can do cool things that general purpose tools like git cannot, particularly with respect to provability and correctness.

Without going too much into detail here, I would personally argue that it's worth it to learn git as a general case and pick up other VCS as you interact with projects that require them.

## What *not* to version
Or, at least, what *not* to upload to GitHub

* Generally, "data"
  * Is yours backed up?
* Binary files (either lots or large)
  * Probably ok to include a few photos, but not 3 hours of audio
  * No meaningful "diffs"
  * For an alternative approach, see the [Git Large File System](https://git-lfs.github.com/). (üëã Franck!)
* Secrets
  * SSH keys
  * Passwords
  * User info
* Build artifacts / generated code
* Other VCS
* As a replacement for backups
* Similarly, VCS generally don't like to be synced (e.g. Dropbox)

# Interactive tutorial
## Getting started with git on your own code
From here on out, I'm going to call a repository a "repo" since it's shorter.

### `git init`
As I mentioned before, a repo is simply a directory where git is tracking changes to files. So, let's create a new repo!

Make sure you're in the directory you want to hold your repos (at least for this tutorial) with `pwd`. Then, make a new directory to hold your repo with `mkdir myTestRepo`.

### `git add`

Special note on `.gitignore`: this hidden file controls what git will not track by default. For example, if you have a particular subfolder that you want *git* to *ignore* (see what I did there), you can put it in your `.gitignore`. Similarly, it accepts wildcards such that you could exclude all `.wav` files from being tracked. Super useful!

### `git commit`

## Working with remote repositories
### Adding a remote
Whether on your network, another drive, or on a centralized server (like GitHub), you can add a link from your local repo to a remote repo with `git remote add`, a name, and a location. If you are beginning with a local repo, it's common to initialize the remote as a bare repo (meaning it doesn't have any items or any commits) so that you can directly `git push` (or, in other words, copy) the current state of your local repo to the new location without any conflicts.

At this point, we should clarify that git can work over the internet using HTTPS or SSH, both of which have upsides and downsides. We'll talk about these in the context of GitHub, but other services (and it's not uncommon to have credentials with multiple servers) would be approached in much the same fashion.
* HTTPS: If you set up a credential manager earlier, the first time you authenticate, you should be able to use your username, password, and 2FA device to sign in and have your credentials securely cached. If not, you'll have to enter your username and password for authentication each and every time you connect. This is frequently easier to work with in terms of access, as SSH ports can sometimes be blocked by firewalls.
* SSH: Much like authenticating with a server, it's possible to interface with GitHub via SSH. One advantage of using SSH keys to authenticate is that they do not provide access to your actual GitHub account, meaning there is some additional security in terms of recovery in case a key is compromised. It can also allow for finer-grained access control. On the other hand, generating and securing SSH keys (such as with ssh-agent) is technically demanding, and the authentication process at the command line may not be as frictionless as with HTTPS.

For example, let's make a new bare repo on GitHub and use it as a remote for our toy repo.

### `git fetch`, `git pull`

### `git clone`
This is the most common way to get a remote repository onto your local machine, but it's more-or-less the same thing as copying the content and adding the source repository as a remote so that you can continue to interact with the "upstream" (often shared) version. Therefore, it's also valid to download a zip of the whole repo (including the .git folder), decompress it where you want, and manually `git remote add` as before.

### What is this webpage?
I'm glad you asked! In fact, this page was automagically generated by GitHub Pages from a repo that you can find [here](https://github.com/1ceaham/dAlembertGitTutorial). Since this page is a regular repo, you can see its history, `git clone` it to your machine, modify it, add your own commits, and generally do whatever you need to with it! You are, of course, bound by the license of the content - for example, on GitHub, if a repo does not have a license, then it is copyrighted and you do not have the right to use, modify or redistribute it, only to read it (even then, only on GitHub).

(If you want a separate class on how to set up GitHub Pages for your free static hosting needs - an academic website, perhaps? - please let me know and we can discuss scheduling another seminar!)

## Collaboration
### Branches
Branches are basically a way to save and switch between different versions of the same repo. This can allow you to work on multiple ideas at the same time without having to worry about their dependencies. They are also often used as a way to distinguish the "doneness" of a given version of the repo.

For example, `master` (the default name of the branch you are on when initializing a repo) is often used as the "release" or "production-ready" branch, meaning it is always ready for end users to deploy. Conversely, `development` is often the "working" branch, where things are integrated and tested, and "feature branches" (which would be named after a given feature, like `add-pizza`) are where a singular idea is being worked on. The idea here is that it's painless to change between all of these (as long as everything is committed), so that you can context switch without having to think about file management.

Eventually, in this model, features that are finished (say you successfully `add-pizza`) get merged into `development`, and when all of the bugs have been ironed out and it's time to make a release, that is finally merged into `master` where most people will go to get the latest stable version of the codebase.

**This is perhaps the second most important reason to use a VCS.**

`git checkout -b`

`git switch <branchname>`

### GitHub "Fork and Pull" Model
Collaboration on GitHub often takes a branch-centered workflow as above. But what happens when you are not a collaborator on a repo you would like to contribute to? You can fork it (thus creating a copy under your own account), and assuming a permissive license, modify it however you like. Frequently, this part of the work is done just as above, with branches. Then, using the web interface, you can file a "Pull Request" to merge your forked, branched version back into the original repo. The owner can respond, perhaps offering comments or suggestions, and if they like the changes you've made, can bring them into the original repo.

### Other Methods
Of course, collaboration is not limited to these forms. Some groups use [mailing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_mailing_list) to send [patches](https://git-send-email.io) via email, including comments, discussion, and logging. Some services introduce webhooks or enforce continuous integration (CI) rules that can automatically test, build, and deploy complex software projects, making it possible to fix a bug from your cell phone.
