# Interactive tutorial
## Getting started with git
### Make a project directory
* `pwd`
* `mkdir myTestRepo`
* `cd myTestRepo`.

### Initialize a repo
* `git init`
* `ls -a`: presence of `.git`

### Add content
* `vi hello.sh` - Open a new file in vi (or vim) named `hello.sh`.
* `i` - Enter "Insert" mode.
* Type (or copy/paste, if your terminal supports that):
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello world"
    ```
* `Esc` - Leave "Insert" mode.
* `:wq`, `Enter` - Issue the command "Write, then quit."
* `chmod +x hello.sh`
* `./hello.sh`

### See what git sees
* `git status`: "untracked"

### Stage files to be added / updated
`git add hello.sh`

Other wildcards:
* `*.txt` - nonrecursive
* `\*.txt` - subdir recursive
* `git add -A` - match working directory

### Ignore files
* `.gitignore`

### Take a snapshot
* `git status`
* `git commit -m "Initial commit."`

### Make a change
* `vi hello.sh` - Open the editor.
* `j` - We're in command mode, so this doesn't insert a character, but instead moves the cursor down a line.
* `llllllllllllllllll` - Move the cursor between `d` and `"`. If you overshoot, you can press `h` as many times as you need to go back the other way.
* `i` - Enter insert mode.
* `, I can use git!` - Enter some text.
* `Esc`, `:wq`, `Enter` - Return to command mode, save, and quit, as before.

### Test it and see what changed
* `./hello.sh`
* `git status`
* `git diff --word-diff hello.sh`

### Snapshot
* `git commit -a -m "Add qualifications."`.

### History and ancestor comparisons
* `git log`
* `git diff --word-diff HEAD~ HEAD hello.sh`
    * `HEAD~~~`: "the parent of the parent of the parent of `HEAD`"
    * `HEAD~4`
    * `HEAD@{yesterday}`
    * `1c002d` as shorthand for `1c002dd4b536e7479fe34593e72e6c6c1819e53b`

### Going back in time
**_DANGER ALERT:_** If you have uncommitted changes in your working directory, the following commands can destroy them, leading to lost work. Make sure you `git status` to make sure your working directory is clean!

* `git checkout HEAD~`
    * `'detached HEAD' state`
* `cat hello.sh`
* `git checkout master`.

### Reverting a change
* `git revert HEAD`: add a new commit "reversing" the last one 

## Working with remote repos
### Adding a remote and pushing
Make a new bare repo on GitHub
* ["New repository"](https://github.com/new) -> `myTestRepo`
* `git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/myTestRepo.git`
* `git push -u origin master*
* https://github.com/Username/myTestRepo.

### Make a change and send to remote
* `git push origin master`

### Pulling from a remote
* Check: `git fetch`
* Download: `git pull`

### Initializing a repo from a remote
* `git clone`
